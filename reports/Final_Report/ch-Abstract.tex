\chapter*{Abstract}
\change{Include some sentences about the field}MERIT.jl is designed to provide a robust, user-friendly and high-performance software framework that aims to increase
the interoperability between microwave imaging systems, the data they produce and the software that analyzes that data.
It contains helper functions as well as inverse scattering algorithms to aid in image reconstruction.
The unique features in Julia, such as parametric polymorphism, multiple dispatch and type stability to name a few, have
allowed MERIT.jl to possess unparalleled customizability and extensibility. MERIT.jl also demonstrates a level of type
safety by implementing a lightweight Points type that allows for the efficient processing of coordinate points. Unlike
traditional methods that represent points as a matrix of numbers, the Points type allows the Julia compiler to recognize
when an incorrect collection is passed in place of the points collection, throwing an error in the process. In this way
MERIT.jl can promise a level of safety without having to compromise on performance, while this strong type safety is not
implemented fully in the library, the Points type serves as a template for future updates.
