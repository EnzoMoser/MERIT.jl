The central conclusions of our original paper remain unaltered: C++ is the fastest alternative, Julia o§ers a great balance of speed and ease of use, and Python is too slow. As the main changes, Matlab and R have considerably improved their performance, in the case of Matlab to make it competitive, for example, with Rcpp}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The Wavelia Microwave Breast Imaging (MBI) system, based on non-ionising imaging technology, has demonstrated exciting potential in the  detection and localisation of breast pathology in symptomatic patients. In this  study, the ability of the system to accurately estimate the size and likelihood  of malignancy of breast lesions is detailed, and its clinical usefulness  determined. METHODS: Institutional review board and Health Products Regulatory  Authority (HPRA) approval were obtained. Patients were recruited from the  symptomatic unit to three groups; breast cancer (Group-1), unaspirated cysts  (Group-2) and biopsied benign lesions (Group-3). MBI, radiological and  histopathological findings were reviewed. MBI size estimations were compared with  the sizes determined by conventional imaging and histopathology. A Quadratic  Discriminant Analysis (QDA) classifier was trained in a 3D feature space to  discriminate malignant from benign lesions. An independent review was performed  by two independent breast radiologists. RESULTS: 24 patients (11 Group-1, 8  Group-2 and 5 Group-3) underwent MBI. The Wavelia system was more accurate than  conventional imaging in size estimation of breast cancers. The QDA accurately  separated benign from malignant breast lesions in 88.5\% of cases. The addition of  MBI and the Wavelia malignancy risk calculation was deemed useful by the two  radiologists in 70.6\% of cases. CONCLUSION: The results from this MBI  investigation demonstrate the potential of this novel system in estimating size  and malignancy risk of breast lesions. This system holds significant promise as a  potential non-invasive, comfortable, and harmless adjunct for breast cancer  diagnosis. Further larger studies are under preparation to validate the findings  of this study. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: This study details the potential of the  Wavelia MBI system in delineating size and malignancy risk of benign and  malignant breast lesions in a symptomatic cohort. The usefulness of the Wavelia  system is assessed in the clinical setting.},

  abstract = {Radar-based breast imaging has shown promise as an imaging modality for early-stage cancer detection, and clinical investigations of two commercial imaging systems are ongoing. Many imaging algorithms have been proposed, which seek to improve the quality of the reconstructed microwave image to enhance the potential clinical decision. However, in many cases, the radar-based imaging algorithms have only been tested in limited numerical or experimental test cases or with simplifying assumptions such as using one estimate of permittivity for all patient test cases. In this work, the potential impact of patient-specific permittivity estimation on algorithm comparison is highlighted using representative experimental breast phantoms. In particular, the case studies presented help show that the permittivity estimate can impact the conclusions of the algorithm comparison. Overall, this work suggests that it is important that imaging algorithm comparisons use realistic test cases with and without breast abnormalities and with reconstruction permittivity estimation.},

  abstract = {Inaccurate estimation of average dielectric properties can have a tangible impact on microwave radar-based breast images. Despite this, recent patient imaging studies have used a fixed estimate although this is known to vary from patient to patient. Parameter search algorithms are a promising technique for estimating the average dielectric properties from the reconstructed microwave images themselves without additional hardware. In this work, qualities of accurately reconstructed images are identified from point spread functions. As the qualities of accurately reconstructed microwave images are similar to the qualities of focused microscopic and photographic images, this work proposes the use of focal quality metrics for average dielectric property estimation. The robustness of the parameter search is evaluated using experimental dielectrically heterogeneous phantoms on the three-dimensional volumetric image. Based on a very broad initial estimate of the average dielectric properties, this paper shows how these metrics can be used as suitable fitness functions in parameter search algorithms to reconstruct clear and focused microwave radar images.},

  abstract = {Many similarities exist between ultrasound and microwave imaging, however, ultrasound is typically performed with a handheld transducer whereas antennas are placed around the subject of imaging for microwave breast imaging. Hence, ultrasound beamformers are not always directly applicable for microwave imaging. Signals traverse different paths experiencing different delays, attenuations, and even different expected shapes of signal due to dispersion. Besides, each signal may contain the response from a different point of the boundary of the object. In this work, increased coherencies between the signals of certain antenna pairs are shown statistically and these characteristics exploited to develop a novel beamformer which weights the received signals prior to imaging using these characteristics. Specifically, a novel data-independent beamformer is proposed by weighting signals based on the relative positions of the antennas. These weights are relevant to the intrinsic worth of signals according to the information of the tumor response. This patient-independent weighting can make the delay-and-sum (DAS) beamformer more robust. The contrast is improved as well, with an absolutely negligible computational load compared to DAS. Weighted-DAS (WDAS) is evaluated using realistic breast phantoms and the improvement of the output quality in comparison to DAS is shown.},
