Microwave imaging is making waves in the medical field, with the potential to create cheaper and safer imaging
modalities. With many systems at various stages of clinical trials, it is important now more than ever to create a
library that can encourage compatibility and interoperability. MERIT.jl achieves this through the use of the Julia
programming language. In its current state, it can ingest data from most systems and perform frequency domain
beamforming to produce an image that is near identical to its MATLAB counterpart. By making use of Parametric
Polymorphism, Multiple dispatch, Type Safety, Type Stability and Closure, MERIT.jl has demonstrated powerful extensibility
and flexibility while also remaining performant. MERIT.jl's open-source nature, near-limitless customizability and
high-level syntax make it an appealing choice to both beginner and advanced researchers alike.
