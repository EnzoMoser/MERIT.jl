%%NEED TO REDO THIS ABSTRACT

MERIT aims to provide a software framework that is robust, easy to use and performant. It implements a variety of
microwave imaging algorithms and a myriad of helper functions, all while leveraging the powerful features available in
Julia. MERIT.jl also implements a ``Scan'' abstract datatype which allows users to subtype their own specialized datatype.
Organizing the datatypes in this way means that MERIT.jl plays very well with Julia's own type hierarchy and also the
other language features that depend on this. To encourage type safety, MERIT.jl implements a lightweight Points class
which allows for efficient processing of coordinate points. In this way, collections of points won't simply be a matrix
of Floats or Ints instead,they would be a Vector of the Points type. In this way, the Julia compiler will throw an
error when Points aren't passed in the right argument, instead of providing a wrong output.
