  abstract = {The Python programming language is known for performing poorly on many tasks. While to some extent this is to be expected from a dynamic language, it is not clear how much each dynamic feature contributes to the costs of interpreting Python. In this study we attempt to quantify the costs of language features such as dynamic typing, reference counting for memory management, boxing of numbers, and late binding of function calls.We use an experimental compilation framework for Python that can make use of type annotations provided by the user to specialize the program as well as elide unnecessary reference counting operations and function lookups. The compiled programs run within the Python interpreter and use its internal API to implement language semantics. By separately enabling and disabling compiler optimizations, we can thus measure how much each language feature contributes to total execution time in the interpreter.We find that a boxed representation of numbers as heap objects is the single most costly language feature on numeric codes, accounting for up to 43\% of total execution time in our benchmark set. On symbolic object-oriented code, late binding of function and method calls costs up to 30\%. Redundant reference counting, dynamic type checks, and Python's elaborate function calling convention have comparatively smaller costs.},

Microwave scattering data were collected at 0.8 to 1.2\&\#x2009;GHz with 24 transmitting and receiving antennas located in a matching fluid of deionized water and table salt. Inversion of the microwave data was performed with a balanced version of the multiplicative-regularized contrast source inversion algorithm formulated using the finite-element method (FEM-CSI). T1-weighted MRI images of each volunteer\&\#x2019;s forearm were also collected in the same plane as the microwave scattering experiment. Initial \&\#x201c;blind\&\#x201d; imaging results from the utilized inversion algorithm show that the image quality is dependent on the thickness of the arm\&\#x2019;s peripheral adipose tissue layer; thicker layers of adipose tissue lead to poorer overall image quality. Due to the exible nature of the FEM-CSI algorithm used, prior information can be readily incorporated into the microwave imaging inversion process. We show that by introducing prior information into the FEM-CSI algorithm the internal anatomical features of all the arms are resolved, significantly improving the images. The prior information was estimated manually from the blind inversions using an \emph{ad hoc} procedure.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The Wavelia Microwave Breast Imaging (MBI) system, based on non-ionising imaging technology, has demonstrated exciting potential in the  detection and localisation of breast pathology in symptomatic patients. In this  study, the ability of the system to accurately estimate the size and likelihood  of malignancy of breast lesions is detailed, and its clinical usefulness  determined. METHODS: Institutional review board and Health Products Regulatory  Authority (HPRA) approval were obtained. Patients were recruited from the  symptomatic unit to three groups; breast cancer (Group-1), unaspirated cysts  (Group-2) and biopsied benign lesions (Group-3). MBI, radiological and  histopathological findings were reviewed. MBI size estimations were compared with  the sizes determined by conventional imaging and histopathology. A Quadratic  Discriminant Analysis (QDA) classifier was trained in a 3D feature space to  discriminate malignant from benign lesions. An independent review was performed  by two independent breast radiologists. RESULTS: 24 patients (11 Group-1, 8  Group-2 and 5 Group-3) underwent MBI. The Wavelia system was more accurate than  conventional imaging in size estimation of breast cancers. The QDA accurately  separated benign from malignant breast lesions in 88.5\% of cases. The addition of  MBI and the Wavelia malignancy risk calculation was deemed useful by the two  radiologists in 70.6\% of cases. CONCLUSION: The results from this MBI  investigation demonstrate the potential of this novel system in estimating size  and malignancy risk of breast lesions. This system holds significant promise as a  potential non-invasive, comfortable, and harmless adjunct for breast cancer  diagnosis. Further larger studies are under preparation to validate the findings  of this study. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: This study details the potential of the  Wavelia MBI system in delineating size and malignancy risk of benign and  malignant breast lesions in a symptomatic cohort. The usefulness of the Wavelia  system is assessed in the clinical setting.},

Many imaging algorithms have been proposed, which seek to improve the quality of the reconstructed microwave image to enhance the potential clinical decision. However, in many cases, the radar-based imaging algorithms have only been tested in limited numerical or experimental test cases or with simplifying assumptions such as using one estimate of permittivity for all patient test cases. In this work, the potential impact of patient-specific permittivity estimation on algorithm comparison is highlighted using representative experimental breast phantoms. In particular, the case studies presented help show that the permittivity estimate can impact the conclusions of the algorithm comparison. Overall, this work suggests that it is important that imaging algorithm comparisons use realistic test cases with and without breast abnormalities and with reconstruction permittivity estimation.},

Despite this, recent patient imaging studies have used a fixed estimate although this is known to vary from patient to patient. Parameter search algorithms are a promising technique for estimating the average dielectric properties from the reconstructed microwave images themselves without additional hardware. In this work, qualities of accurately reconstructed images are identified from point spread functions. As the qualities of accurately reconstructed microwave images are similar to the qualities of focused microscopic and photographic images, this work proposes the use of focal quality metrics for average dielectric property estimation. The robustness of the parameter search is evaluated using experimental dielectrically heterogeneous phantoms on the three-dimensional volumetric image. Based on a very broad initial estimate of the average dielectric properties, this paper shows how these metrics can be used as suitable fitness functions in parameter search algorithms to reconstruct clear and focused microwave radar images.},

  abstract = {Many similarities exist between ultrasound and microwave imaging, however, ultrasound is typically performed with a handheld transducer whereas antennas are placed around the subject of imaging for microwave breast imaging. Hence, ultrasound beamformers are not always directly applicable for microwave imaging. Signals traverse different paths experiencing different delays, attenuations, and even different expected shapes of signal due to dispersion. Besides, each signal may contain the response from a different point of the boundary of the object. In this work, increased coherencies between the signals of certain antenna pairs are shown statistically and these characteristics exploited to develop a novel beamformer which weights the received signals prior to imaging using these characteristics. Specifically, a novel data-independent beamformer is proposed by weighting signals based on the relative positions of the antennas. These weights are relevant to the intrinsic worth of signals according to the information of the tumor response. This patient-independent weighting can make the delay-and-sum (DAS) beamformer more robust. The contrast is improved as well, with an absolutely negligible computational load compared to DAS. Weighted-DAS (WDAS) is evaluated using realistic breast phantoms and the improvement of the output quality in comparison to DAS is shown.},
