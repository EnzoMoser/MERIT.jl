\chapter*{Abstract}
Microwave imaging is being trialed as a safer and cheaper imaging modality over X-rays and ultrasound which is the
current modality of choice in medical imaging. In the last 8 years, 10 clinical studies have been conducted that trialed
novel microwave imaging systems, focused mainly in the area of breast tumor detection. The success of these trials has
proven the viability of microwaves as an alternate imaging modality. MERIT.jl, then, aims to be a reliable,
user-friendly and high-performance software framework that aims to increase the interoperability between microwave
imaging systems, the data they produce and the software that analyzes that data. It contains helper functions as well as
inverse scattering algorithms to aid in image reconstruction. The unique features in Julia, such as parametric
polymorphism, multiple dispatch and type stability to name a few, have allowed MERIT.jl to possess unparalleled
customizability and extensibility. The library also demonstrates a level of type safety by implementing a lightweight
Points type that allows for the efficient processing of coordinate points. Unlike traditional methods that represent
points as a matrix of numbers, the Points type allows the Julia compiler to recognize when an incorrect collection is
passed in place of the points collection, throwing an error in the process. In this way, MERIT.jl can promise a level of
safety without having to compromise on performance.
