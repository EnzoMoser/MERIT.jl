  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The Wavelia Microwave Breast Imaging (MBI) system, based on non-ionising imaging technology, has demonstrated exciting potential in the  detection and localisation of breast pathology in symptomatic patients. In this  study, the ability of the system to accurately estimate the size and likelihood  of malignancy of breast lesions is detailed, and its clinical usefulness  determined. METHODS: Institutional review board and Health Products Regulatory  Authority (HPRA) approval were obtained. Patients were recruited from the  symptomatic unit to three groups; breast cancer (Group-1), unaspirated cysts  (Group-2) and biopsied benign lesions (Group-3). MBI, radiological and  histopathological findings were reviewed. MBI size estimations were compared with  the sizes determined by conventional imaging and histopathology. A Quadratic  Discriminant Analysis (QDA) classifier was trained in a 3D feature space to  discriminate malignant from benign lesions. An independent review was performed  by two independent breast radiologists. RESULTS: 24 patients (11 Group-1, 8  Group-2 and 5 Group-3) underwent MBI. The Wavelia system was more accurate than  conventional imaging in size estimation of breast cancers. The QDA accurately  separated benign from malignant breast lesions in 88.5\% of cases. The addition of  MBI and the Wavelia malignancy risk calculation was deemed useful by the two  radiologists in 70.6\% of cases. CONCLUSION: The results from this MBI  investigation demonstrate the potential of this novel system in estimating size  and malignancy risk of breast lesions. This system holds significant promise as a  potential non-invasive, comfortable, and harmless adjunct for breast cancer  diagnosis. Further larger studies are under preparation to validate the findings  of this study. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: This study details the potential of the  Wavelia MBI system in delineating size and malignancy risk of benign and  malignant breast lesions in a symptomatic cohort. The usefulness of the Wavelia  system is assessed in the clinical setting.},

A total of  86 patients recruited from a symptomatic breast care clinic were scanned with a  prototype design. The resultant three-dimensional images have been compared  "blind" with available ultrasound and mammogram images to determine the detection  rate. Images show the location of the strongest signal, and this corresponded in  both older and younger women, with sensitivity of [Formula: see text], which was  found to be maintained in dense breasts.
