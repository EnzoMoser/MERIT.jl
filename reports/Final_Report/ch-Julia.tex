\section{Why Julia?}
One of the goals of MERIT.jl was to streamline the development process for new imaging algorithms. As well as this
MERIT.jl aims to lower the barrier of entry and the coding knowledge needed in order to set up these data processing and
visualizing pipelines. In order to fulfill these dreams, the right coding language needed to be selected. Since the
barrier of entry needs to be low, a high-level language needs to be selected and since the primary target of MERIT.jl
are researchers, it needs to be a language that they are familiar with, or one which they can easily learn. If the
language chosen is too difficult to learn, any potential time savings from the ease of use would be heavily outweighed
by the time spent learning the language. \hfill \break

Python was one of the languages considered. Python's philosophy was code readability over all and this fact is
complimented by it's high-level syntax and indentation requirements.
